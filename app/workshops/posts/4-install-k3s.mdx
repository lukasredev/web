# Installing k3s: Lightweight Kubernetes

k3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed by Rancher Labs. It's perfect for our workshop environment—providing full Kubernetes functionality while using minimal resources. In this guide, you'll install k3s on your assigned VM and verify that your cluster is running.

## Step 0: Connect to Your VM

Each workshop participant has their own virtual machine. Connect using SSH:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@dj-viscon-workshop-0.vsos.ethz.ch
```

Replace `0` with your assigned participant number. You'll be working as the `ubuntu` user throughout the workshop.

## Step 1: Install k3s

The official k3s installation script handles everything automatically:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

This single command will:
- Download the latest k3s binary
- Configure systemd services
- Start the k3s server

**Installing a specific version (optional):**

If you need a particular k3s version:
```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION="v1.28.0+k3s1" sh -
```

## Step 2: Verify Installation

Check that k3s is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status k3s
```

You should see `active (running)` in the output.

Verify your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
sudo k3s kubectl get nodes
```

Your node should appear with status `Ready`. Congratulations—you now have a working Kubernetes cluster!

## Step 3: Simplify kubectl Access

k3s includes kubectl, but it requires `sudo` by default. Create a symlink for easier access:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/k3s /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

Now you can use standard kubectl commands:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

For even easier access without sudo, copy the kubeconfig:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kube
sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.kube/config
```

## Understanding k3s

k3s achieves its lightweight footprint by:
- Packaging everything into a single binary (< 100MB)
- Using SQLite instead of etcd by default
- Removing optional features and cloud provider integrations
- Including Traefik as the default ingress controller

Despite these optimizations, k3s is fully certified Kubernetes and supports all standard workloads.

## Optional: Multi-Node Setup

While our workshop uses single-node clusters, k3s makes it easy to add worker nodes.

**On the master node**, retrieve the join token:
```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
```

**On a worker node**, join the cluster:
```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://<MASTER_IP>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<TOKEN> sh -
```

The worker automatically registers with your cluster.

## Next Steps

With k3s installed and verified, you're ready to start deploying applications. In the next section, we'll set up GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy your code to this cluster.
