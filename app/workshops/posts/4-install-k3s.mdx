# Installing k3s: Lightweight Kubernetes

k3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed by Rancher Labs. It's perfect for our workshop environment—providing full Kubernetes functionality while using minimal resources. In this guide, you'll install k3s on your assigned VM and verify that your cluster is running.

## Step 0: Connect to Your VM

Each workshop participant has their own virtual machine. Connect using SSH:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@dj-viscon-workshop-0.vsos.ethz.ch
```

Replace `0` with your assigned participant number. You'll be working as the `ubuntu` user throughout the workshop.

## Step 1: Install k3s

The official k3s installation script handles everything automatically:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - server \
  --write-kubeconfig-mode 644
```

This single command will:
- Download the latest k3s binary
- Configure systemd services
- Start the k3s server

## Step 2: Verify Installation

Check that k3s is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status k3s
```

You should see `active (running)` in the output.

Verify your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Your node should appear with status `Ready`. Congratulations—you now have a working Kubernetes cluster!

## Understanding k3s

k3s achieves its lightweight footprint by:
- Packaging everything into a single binary (< 100MB)
- Including Traefik as the default ingress controller

Despite these optimizations, k3s is fully certified Kubernetes and supports all standard workloads.

## Next Steps

With k3s installed and verified, you're ready to deploy your application! Continue to [Step 5: Deploy Your App to Kubernetes](/workshops/5-deploy-app) to create Deployments and Services that run your application in the cluster.
