# Setup Application Locally

Before we deploy to the cloud, let's get the application running on your local machine. This guide will walk you through cloning the repository, installing Docker, and running the application with Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine
- A terminal or command prompt
- Basic familiarity with command line

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and clone the workshop application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukasredev/furnet
cd furnet
```

This downloads the application code to your local machine and navigates into the project directory.

## Step 2: Install Docker

Docker packages your application with all its dependencies, making it easy to run consistently across different environments.

### macOS

**Option A: Docker Desktop (Recommended)**

1. Download Docker Desktop from [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag Docker to your Applications folder
3. Launch Docker Desktop from Applications
4. Wait for Docker to start (the whale icon in the menu bar will be steady)

**Option B: Homebrew**

```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

### Windows

1. Download Docker Desktop from [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Run the installer
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Restart your computer if prompted
5. Launch Docker Desktop

**Note:** Docker Desktop on Windows requires WSL 2. The installer will guide you through enabling it if needed.

### Linux

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
# Update package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg

# Add Docker's official GPG key
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Set up repository
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

### Verify Docker Installation

Check that Docker is installed correctly:

```bash
docker --version
```

You should see output like: `Docker version 24.0.0, build abc1234`

## Step 3: Install Docker Compose

Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container applications.

### macOS and Windows

If you installed Docker Desktop, Docker Compose is already included. Verify with:

```bash
docker compose version
```

### Linux

Docker Compose is included with recent Docker installations as a plugin. If you followed the installation steps above, you should already have it.

Verify with:

```bash
docker compose version
```

If you need to install it separately:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin
```

## Step 4: Run the Application

Now that everything is installed, start the application:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

**What this command does:**
- `docker compose up`: Starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`
- `--build`: Rebuilds the Docker images before starting (ensures you have the latest code)

**First run:** This will take a few minutes as Docker downloads base images and builds your containers.

### What You'll See

Docker Compose will output logs from all services. You should see something like:

```
[+] Building 45.2s
[+] Running 2/2
 ✔ Container furnet-backend-1   Started
 ✔ Container furnet-frontend-1  Started
Attaching to backend-1, frontend-1
backend-1  | Server running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
frontend-1 | Server running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

## Step 5: Access the Application

Once the containers are running, open your browser and navigate to:

- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **Backend API**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

You should see the application's interface in your browser.

## Common Commands

### Stop the application

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Docker Compose is running, or use:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Restart with fresh build

If you make changes to the code:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### View running containers

```bash
docker compose ps
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use

If you see an error like "port is already allocated":

```bash
# Find what's using the port (macOS/Linux)
lsof -i :8080

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :8080
```

Either stop the conflicting process or modify the port in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Permission denied (Linux)

If you get permission errors:

```bash
# Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and back in for changes to take effect
```

### Docker daemon not running

Make sure Docker Desktop is running (macOS/Windows) or start the Docker service (Linux):

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have the application running locally, you're ready to:
1. Set up SSH keys for cloud access
2. Install k3s on your workshop VM
3. Create a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
4. Deploy to production with Kubernetes

The local setup helps you understand the application before automating its deployment to the cloud.
