# Setup Application Locally

Before we deploy to the cloud, let's get the application running on your local machine. You'll fork the repository to create your own copy, customize your unique animal identity, and run the application with Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine
- A GitHub account (free tier works perfectly)
- A terminal or command prompt
- Basic familiarity with command line

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

**Why fork instead of clone?**

In this workshop, you'll be making code changes (customizing your animal) and pushing them to GitHub. Forking creates your own copy of the repository that you have full control over.

### Fork on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com/lukasredev/furnet](https://github.com/lukasredev/furnet)
2. Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination
4. Wait for GitHub to create your fork

You now have your own copy at `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/furnet`!

### Clone Your Fork

Now clone your fork (not the original repository):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/furnet
cd furnet
```

**Important:** Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

This downloads your forked repository to your local machine and navigates into the project directory.

## Step 2: Customize Your Animal Identity

FurNet is a distributed social network where each instance represents a participant with a unique animal identity. Before running the application, let's customize your animal!

### Understanding Animal Configuration

Each FurNet instance has an animal identity defined in `backend/config.py`. This includes:
- **Required fields**: Name, species, and description
- **Optional fields**: Habitat, diet, fun fact, emoji, and color

**Workshop Concept:** Everyone in the workshop will deploy their own animal, and your instances can connect to each other, forming a distributed social network of animals!

### Edit the Configuration File

Open `backend/config.py` in your favorite text editor:

```bash
nano backend/config.py
# or use your preferred editor:
# code backend/config.py    # VS Code
# vim backend/config.py     # Vim
# open -a TextEdit backend/config.py  # macOS TextEdit
```

### Customize Your Animal

Find the `AnimalConfig` class (around line 27) and customize the values:

```python
class AnimalConfig:
    """
    Animal identity configuration for this FurNet instance.

    WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS: Edit these values to personalize your animal!
    These are hardcoded and not loaded from environment variables.
    """
    # Animal Identity - Fixed Fields (Required)
    animal_name: str = "Rusty"              # ← Change this to your animal's name
    animal_species: str = "Red Panda"       # ← Change this to your animal species
    animal_description: str = "A curious and playful red panda who loves to explore"  # ← Your description

    # Animal Identity - Optional Fields (customize these too!)
    animal_habitat: Optional[str] = "Bamboo forests of the Himalayas"
    animal_diet: Optional[str] = "Bamboo, fruits, and occasional insects"
    animal_fun_fact: Optional[str] = "Red pandas use their bushy tails as blankets in cold weather"
    animal_emoji: Optional[str] = "🐼"
    animal_color: Optional[str] = "rust-red"
```

### Choose Your Animal

Pick any animal you like! Here are some ideas to get you started:

**Land Animals:**
- Arctic Fox: "A clever arctic fox with brilliant white winter fur"
- Elephant: "A gentle giant with remarkable memory and intelligence"
- Meerkat: "A social meerkat always on the lookout for adventure"
- Sloth: "A relaxed sloth taking life at a comfortable pace"

**Ocean Animals:**
- Sea Otter: "A playful sea otter who floats on their back"
- Dolphin: "An intelligent dolphin who loves solving problems"
- Octopus: "A mysterious octopus with eight arms of creativity"

**Sky Animals:**
- Owl: "A wise owl active during the quiet night hours"
- Hummingbird: "A tiny hummingbird with incredible speed and agility"
- Eagle: "A majestic eagle soaring high above the mountains"

**Mythical/Fun:**
- Dragon: "A friendly dragon who collects interesting code snippets"
- Penguin: "A tuxedo-wearing penguin who loves cold climates and Linux"

**Example Customization:**

```python
class AnimalConfig:
    # Animal Identity - Fixed Fields (Required)
    animal_name: str = "Luna"
    animal_species: str = "Arctic Fox"
    animal_description: str = "A clever arctic fox with brilliant white winter fur and keen problem-solving skills"

    # Animal Identity - Optional Fields
    animal_habitat: Optional[str] = "Arctic tundra and snowy mountains"
    animal_diet: Optional[str] = "Small rodents, birds, and berries"
    animal_fun_fact: Optional[str] = "Arctic foxes can survive temperatures as low as -70°C"
    animal_emoji: Optional[str] = "🦊"
    animal_color: Optional[str] = "snow-white"
```

### Save Your Changes

After customizing your animal:

1. Save the file (`Ctrl+O` then `Enter` in nano, or `Cmd+S` in most editors)
2. Exit the editor (`Ctrl+X` in nano)

### Commit Your Changes

Now commit your customized animal to your fork:

```bash
git add backend/config.py
git commit -m "feat: customize animal identity to [YOUR-ANIMAL-SPECIES]"
git push origin main
```

**Why commit now?**

When you set up GitHub Actions in the next section, it will automatically build your customized animal into Docker images. This way, your deployed instance will have your unique animal identity!

## Step 3: Install Docker

Docker packages your application with all its dependencies, making it easy to run consistently across different environments.

### macOS

**Option A: Docker Desktop (Recommended)**

1. Download Docker Desktop from [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag Docker to your Applications folder
3. Launch Docker Desktop from Applications
4. Wait for Docker to start (the whale icon in the menu bar will be steady)

**Option B: Homebrew**

```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

### Windows

1. Download Docker Desktop from [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Run the installer
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Restart your computer if prompted
5. Launch Docker Desktop

**Note:** Docker Desktop on Windows requires WSL 2. The installer will guide you through enabling it if needed.

### Linux

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
# Update package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg

# Add Docker's official GPG key
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Set up repository
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

### Verify Docker Installation

Check that Docker is installed correctly:

```bash
docker --version
```

You should see output like: `Docker version 24.0.0, build abc1234`

## Step 4: Install Docker Compose

Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container applications.

### macOS and Windows

If you installed Docker Desktop, Docker Compose is already included. Verify with:

```bash
docker compose version
```

### Linux

Docker Compose is included with recent Docker installations as a plugin. If you followed the installation steps above, you should already have it.

Verify with:

```bash
docker compose version
```

If you need to install it separately:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin
```

## Step 5: Run the Application

Now that everything is installed, start the application:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

**What this command does:**
- `docker compose up`: Starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`
- `--build`: Rebuilds the Docker images before starting (ensures you have the latest code)

**First run:** This will take a few minutes as Docker downloads base images and builds your containers.

### What You'll See

Docker Compose will output logs from all services. You should see something like:

```
[+] Building 45.2s
[+] Running 2/2
 ✔ Container furnet-backend-1   Started
 ✔ Container furnet-frontend-1  Started
Attaching to backend-1, frontend-1
backend-1  | Server running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
frontend-1 | Server running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

## Step 6: Access the Application

Once the containers are running, open your browser and navigate to:

- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **Backend API**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

You should see the application's interface in your browser.

### Verify Your Animal Identity

Check that your customized animal appears correctly:

1. **Visit the frontend** at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
   - You should see your animal's name, species, and description

2. **Check the API directly** at [http://localhost:8000/api/me](http://localhost:8000/api/me)
   - This endpoint returns your animal's full profile as JSON
   - Verify all your customized fields appear correctly

**Example API response:**

```json
{
  "id": "localhost:luna",
  "name": "Luna",
  "species": "Arctic Fox",
  "description": "A clever arctic fox with brilliant white winter fur and keen problem-solving skills",
  "instance_url": "http://localhost:8000",
  "habitat": "Arctic tundra and snowy mountains",
  "diet": "Small rodents, birds, and berries",
  "fun_fact": "Arctic foxes can survive temperatures as low as -70°C",
  "emoji": "🦊",
  "color": "snow-white"
}
```

**Troubleshooting:** If you still see "Rusty the Red Panda", you may need to rebuild:

```bash
# Stop the containers
docker compose down

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose up --build
```

## Common Commands

### Stop the application

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Docker Compose is running, or use:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Restart with fresh build

If you make changes to the code:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### View running containers

```bash
docker compose ps
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use

If you see an error like "port is already allocated":

```bash
# Find what's using the port (macOS/Linux)
lsof -i :8080

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :8080
```

Either stop the conflicting process or modify the port in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Permission denied (Linux)

If you get permission errors:

```bash
# Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and back in for changes to take effect
```

### Docker daemon not running

Make sure Docker Desktop is running (macOS/Windows) or start the Docker service (Linux):

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```
