# Achievements and Future Steps

## Congratulations!

You've successfully completed the Cloud-Native DevOps workshop! Your application is now:
- ✓ Publicly accessible via HTTPS
- ✓ Protected with a valid SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
- ✓ Automatically secured and renewed by cert-manager
- ✓ Routed efficiently by Traefik
- ✓ Running on a production-ready Kubernetes cluster

## Testing Your Complete CI/CD Pipeline

Now let's test your entire pipeline by making a code change and watching it flow through your CI/CD system!

### Step 1: Make a Code Change

Let's personalize your FurNet animal! Edit your animal configuration:

```bash
# Navigate to your furnet directory
cd ~/furnet

# Open the animal config file
vim backend/config.py
```

Find the `AnimalConfig` class and customize your animal:

```python
class AnimalConfig:
    # Animal Identity - Fixed Fields (Required)
    animal_name: str = "Your Animal Name"  # Change this!
    animal_species: str = "Your Species"   # Change this!
    animal_description: str = "A description of your animal"  # Change this!

    # Optional Fields - customize these too!
    animal_habitat: Optional[str] = "Where your animal lives"
    animal_diet: Optional[str] = "What your animal eats"
    animal_fun_fact: Optional[str] = "Something interesting about your animal"
    animal_emoji: Optional[str] = "🦊"  # Pick your favorite emoji!
    animal_color: Optional[str] = "your-color"
```

Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano).

### Step 2: Commit and Push

Now commit your changes and push them to GitHub:

```bash
# Check what changed
git status
git diff backend/config.py

# Stage and commit your changes
git add backend/config.py
git commit -m "feat: update animal configuration to [Your Animal]"

# Push to GitHub (this triggers the CI/CD pipeline!)
git push origin main
```

**What happens now:** Your push to `main` triggers the GitHub Actions workflow to build new Docker images.

### Step 3: Watch the GitHub Action Build

Open your browser and watch the build process:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the **Actions** tab
3. You should see a new workflow run called "Build and Push Docker Images"
4. Click on it to watch the progress

You'll see these steps execute:
- ✓ Checkout repository
- ✓ Set up Docker Buildx
- ✓ Log in to GitHub Container Registry
- ✓ Extract metadata for Backend/Frontend
- ✓ Build and push Backend Docker image
- ✓ Build and push Frontend Docker image

**Wait for the green checkmark!** This means your new images are built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry.

### Step 4: Deploy the New Images to k3s

Your new images are built, but your k3s cluster is still running the old ones. Let's update it!

SSH into your cloud VM:

```bash
# Replace 0 with your participant number (0, 1, 2, etc.)
ssh ubuntu@dj-viscon-workshop-0.vsos.ethz.ch
```

**Why is this step needed?** Your Kubernetes deployment is configured with `imagePullPolicy: Always`, which means it will always try to pull the latest image. However, Kubernetes doesn't automatically know when a new image with the same tag (like `latest`) has been pushed to the registry. The `rollout restart` command tells Kubernetes to recreate the pods, which triggers a fresh image pull.

Now trigger a rollout restart to pull the new images:

```bash
# Restart the backend deployment (contains your animal config)
kubectl rollout restart deployment furnet-backend

# Restart the frontend too (for good measure)
kubectl rollout restart deployment furnet-frontend
```

**What this does:** Kubernetes will gracefully terminate the old pods and create new ones. During pod creation, it pulls the latest images from GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) with your updated animal configuration.

Watch the rollout happen:

```bash
# Watch pods being recreated
kubectl get pods -w

# Press Ctrl+C when you see the new pods running
```

You should see:
1. Old pods terminating (`Terminating` state)
2. New pods being created (`ContainerCreating` state)
3. New pods running (`Running` state)

### Step 5: Verify Your Changes

Visit your application in the browser:

```
https://dj-viscon-workshop-0.vsos.ethz.ch
```

Check the `/api/me` endpoint to see your updated animal:

```
https://dj-viscon-workshop-0.vsos.ethz.ch/api/me
```

You should see your new animal configuration! 🎉

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Still seeing old config?** Check that the GitHub Action completed successfully
- **Pods not starting?** Run `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to see errors
- **Can't pull image?** Verify the image exists in GitHub Container Registry

### Understanding the Full Pipeline

You just experienced a complete CI/CD flow:

1. **Code Change** → Edit `backend/config.py`
2. **Version Control** → `git commit` and `git push`
3. **Continuous Integration** → GitHub Actions builds Docker images
4. **Container Registry** → Images pushed to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
5. **Continuous Deployment** → `kubectl rollout restart` pulls new images
6. **Live Application** → Your changes are now running in production!

## What You've Accomplished

Through this workshop, you've built a complete DevOps pipeline from scratch:

1. **Infrastructure**: Set up a k3s Kubernetes cluster on a cloud VM
2. **CI/CD**: Automated Docker image builds with GitHub Actions
3. **Deployment**: Created Kubernetes Deployments and Services
4. **Networking**: Exposed your application with Traefik Ingress
5. **Security**: Automated SSL certificate management with cert-manager
6. **Pipeline Testing**: Successfully deployed code changes through the entire stack!

## Next Steps

Want to take your DevOps skills further? Here are some ideas:

**Full Automation:**
- Automatically rollout the new images in k3s

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- Install Prometheus and Grafana for metrics


## Thank You!
