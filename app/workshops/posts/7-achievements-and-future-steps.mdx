# Achievements and Future Steps

## Congratulations!

You've successfully completed the Cloud-Native DevOps workshop! Your application is now:
- ✓ Publicly accessible via HTTPS
- ✓ Protected with a valid SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
- ✓ Automatically secured and renewed by cert-manager
- ✓ Routed efficiently by Traefik
- ✓ Running on a production-ready Kubernetes cluster

## What You've Accomplished

Through this workshop, you've built a complete DevOps pipeline from scratch:

1. **Infrastructure**: Set up a k3s Kubernetes cluster on a cloud VM
2. **CI/CD**: Automated Docker image builds with GitHub Actions
3. **Deployment**: Created Kubernetes Deployments and Services
4. **Networking**: Exposed your application with Traefik Ingress
5. **Security**: Automated SSL certificate management with cert-manager

Every time you push code changes to GitHub, your images rebuild automatically. You can then deploy the updated images to your cluster with a simple `kubectl apply`.

## Next Steps

Want to take your DevOps skills further? Here are some ideas:

**Automation:**
- Set up automatic deployment on every code push using GitHub Actions

**Monitoring:**
- Install Prometheus and Grafana for metrics

## Thank You!

Thank you for participating in the VIScon 2025 Cloud-Native DevOps workshop! You now have real-world skills and a working pipeline you can use for your own projects. Keep experimenting, keep building, and most importantly—keep learning!
