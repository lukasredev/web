# Cloud-Native DevOps: From Code to Production in One Afternoon

Build a complete production-ready DevOps pipeline from scratch! Using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes on a cloud VM, you'll create an automated workflow that deploys code changes to a live website, including SSL certificates, custom DNS, and monitoring—all within a single workshop session.

## The Journey

Follow the path of code from your laptop to production in this intensive hands-on workshop. You'll build a professional-grade deployment pipeline that mirrors what tech companies use in production. Starting with just your code and ending with a live, monitored website accessible to the world.

## The Complete Pipeline You'll Build

- **GitHub repository** with automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- **Container images** built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry
- **k3s Kubernetes cluster** deployed on a cloud VM
- **Automatic deployments** triggered by every code commit
- **Custom domain name** with automated SSL certificate provisioning
- **Monitoring dashboard** to track your application's health

## What You'll Learn

- Modern GitOps workflows and best practices
- Container orchestration with lightweight Kubernetes (k3s)
- Infrastructure automation using GitHub Actions
- SSL/TLS certificate management with Let's Encrypt
- DNS configuration and domain management
- Application monitoring and observability fundamentals
- Security considerations for cloud deployments

## Workshop Structure

We'll work through each component step-by-step, ensuring everyone understands both the "how" and the "why" behind each tool. You can bring your own cloud VM (SOSETH, Hetzner, etc.) or use pre-provisioned instances I'll provide. We'll start with a simple web application and progressively add complexity, culminating in a fully automated deployment that responds to every GitHub commit.

## Who Should Attend

Perfect for students and developers who want to understand modern DevOps practices beyond basic tutorials. Some familiarity with Git, Docker, and the command line is helpful, but we'll cover the essentials as we go. Whether you're preparing for internships, planning personal projects, or just curious about how modern software deployment works, this workshop provides real-world skills.

## Takeaways

You'll leave with a working production pipeline you can use for future projects, plus all configuration files, scripts, and a comprehensive guide to replicate and extend the setup. Most importantly, you'll understand how these tools work together and why this architecture is so powerful for modern software development.

## Workshop Details

**Date**: Coming Soon
**Duration**: One Afternoon
**Level**: Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Basic familiarity with Git, Docker, and command line

## About the Instructor

My DevOps journey started at VIS and VSETH (2017-2022), where I co-led the migration of VSETH's entire infrastructure to a cloud-native Kubernetes setup through the SIP project. Now, as a Solution Architect at DeepJudge, I deploy complex applications across diverse environments using Kubernetes. There's something deeply satisfying about building systems that work seamlessly, and I'm excited to share that experience with you through hands-on learning.
