# Setup SSH Keys

SSH keys enable secure, password-free authentication to your cloud VM. Before the workshop begins, you'll need to generate an SSH key pair and share your public key with the workshop organizer. This guide walks you through the process for all operating systems.

## Understanding SSH Keys

An SSH key pair consists of two files:
- **Private key**: Stays on your machine, never shared
- **Public key**: Can be safely shared and will be added to your workshop VM

## macOS and Linux Users

### Check for Existing Keys

In your terminal:
```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

If you see `id_ed25519.pub` or `id_rsa.pub`, you already have a key pair. Display and copy it:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### Generate a New SSH Key

Run:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

If ed25519 isn't supported, use RSA:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Press Enter for all prompts to accept defaults.

### Copy Your Public Key

Display your public key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Or for RSA:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Send your public key by email to **lukasre@deepjudge.ai** with the following information:
- **Subject**: VIScon 2025 Workshop - SSH Key Submission
- **Public SSH Key**: (the full line you copied above)
- **Your Name**:
- **GitHub Username**:
- **ETHZ Username**:
- **VSETH/VSUZH Member**: (Yes/No)

## Windows Users

### Check for Existing SSH Client

Modern Windows (10 and 11) includes an SSH client by default.

Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
ssh
```

If you see SSH command help output, you're ready to go. Otherwise, continue to the installation step.

### Check for Existing Keys

In PowerShell:
```powershell
dir ~/.ssh
```

If you see `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`, you already have a key pair. Skip to the "Copy Your Public Key" section.

### Generate a New SSH Key

In PowerShell:
```powershell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

If ed25519 isn't supported, use RSA:
```powershell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

When prompted:
- **Save location**: Press Enter to accept default (`C:\Users\<yourname>\.ssh\id_ed25519`)
- **Passphrase**: Press Enter twice to skip (optional but convenient for workshop)

### Copy Your Public Key

Display your public key:
```powershell
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Or for RSA:
```powershell
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Send your public key by email to **lukasre@deepjudge.ai** with the following information:
- **Subject**: VIScon 2025 Workshop - SSH Key Submission
- **Public SSH Key**: (the entire line starting with `ssh-ed25519` or `ssh-rsa`)
- **Your Name**:
- **GitHub Username**:
- **ETHZ Username**:
- **VSETH/VSUZH Member**: (Yes/No)

## Security Reminders

- **Only share your public key** (the `.pub` file)
- **Never share your private key** (the file without `.pub`)
- Your private key should remain secure on your local machine
- If you accidentally expose your private key, generate a new pair immediately

## Next Steps

Once you've submitted your public key, you'll be assigned a workshop VM. Continue to [Step 2: Setup Application Locally](/workshops/2-setup-application) to fork the workshop repository and customize your unique animal identity.
