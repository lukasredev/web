# Thai Curry

**Servings:** 6–8 portions

## Ingredients

- 1 liter coconut milk
- 6 tablespoons Thai curry paste (red or green, no need to defrost)
- 200ml vegetable stock
- 800g carrots, cut into pieces
- 1 medium broccoli, cut into florets
- 600g firm tofu, pressed and cubed
- 4 tablespoons palm sugar (or 2 tablespoons brown sugar)
- 6 tablespoons vegan fish sauce

**If you don't have fish sauce:** Replace fish sauce with 4 tablespoons soy sauce + 2 tablespoons rice vinegar

## Instructions

1. Cut tofu into cubes. Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat and fry until golden on all sides. Set aside.
2. Pour 200ml of coconut milk into a pot. Add the curry paste and bring to a boil. Stir continuously over medium heat until the paste thickens and you see oil separating from the mixture.
(The curry paste is not cooked so this step is essential)
3. Add the remaining coconut milk and vegetable stock. Bring to a simmer.
4. Stir in the palm sugar and fish sauce. Adjust to your taste.
5. Add the carrots first (they need more time). Simmer for 5–7 minutes, then add the broccoli. Cook for another 4–5 minutes until vegetables are getting soft but still have some bite.
6. Add the tofu, simmer for a few minutes.
7. Serve with Jasmin Rice.

## Tips

- **Vegetable variations:** Bell peppers or other vegetables can work well too (negar: do not use bell peppers, they are schmutz :))
- **Pressing tofu:** Wrap in paper towels and place a heavy object on top for 15–30 minutes to remove some water. This makes it more crispy when frying.
- **Curry paste intensity:** Start with less paste you can add more later.
